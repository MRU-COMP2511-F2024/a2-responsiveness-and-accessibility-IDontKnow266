### Sketches for the website and short description

![Home Page](/images/Assignment%201%20-%20Planning%20Home%20Page.jpg)

- This is the home page of our website that we planned out for the assignment, it is going to showcase a variety of elements, like floating images, quick links to the two favorite video game series by each host and much more.

![Two Web Pages](/images/Assignment%201%20-%20Planning%20Two%20Webpages.jpg)

- This is how our two webpages one for Resident Evil and one for God of War will look, we went with a similar design to the each other to maintain consistency and look clean all around.

# Part 2
> This is where you should describe how the Gestalt principles apply to your site

### Gestalt principles write-up (point form)
> Include images here to make your points easier to understand (and you will have to write less too!)

<h4>Proximity</h4>
- The contact form has buttons placed near each other to help the flow of the text, same with the nav bar.

![Nav Bar](/images/Proximity%20-%202%20-%20COMP%202511.png)

<h4>Similarity</h4>
- All three of our web pages have the same background color, black, same red accents, and gray text

<h4>Continuity</h4>
- Each of our webpages are designed to be scrolled from top to bottom, to help continue the natural path when scrolling on the internet. 

<h4>Closure</h4>
- We used thin dividing lines and titles to help seperate sections without boxing them.

<h4>Symmetry</h4>
- There is a lot of artifical shapes in the websites, shapes that are not complete but relate to closure. The webpages are all made with symmetry in mind, balanced layouts are used throughout all the webpages.

<h4>Figure</h4>
- The background is purely black, with red accents, that way in the dark background the red picks up nicely to make it clearer and there is also gray text used that will blend into the background but still be readable. It helps with creating a airy environment.

<h4>Common Fate</h4>
- We used smooth scrolling to help the scrolling appear less jittery. There are also highlighted links that have a hover element.
