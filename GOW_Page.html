                <p>
                    God of War 2018 is a continuation of the story from the original Greek mythology games, God of War 1, God of War 2, and God of War 3.
                    This time around it is based on the Norse mythology, in ancient Norway, Kratos has a son named Atreus, the game starts after Kratos' second wife Faye passes away,
                    The two are going on a journey across Midgard to spread Faye's ashes from the highest peak.

                    This original God of War games were hack and slash games, this one changes many aspects of the original to create a new adventerous experience, the game uses story, graphics, and thrilling combat to keep the game fresh.
                    This game had good reception from the God of War fans and was one of my personal favorites, the breath taking atmosphere combined with the harminous music in the game creates an almost life-like experience for the player.

                <h2>Fun Fact #1</h2>
                <p>Kratos is originally from Greek mythology, in the first 3 God of War games, he was also the leader of the spartans and is Zeus's son.
                    Kratos is the God of Strength, he was forced into slavery by Ares who is the God of War, he was sent on a mission to destroy a village and during his rage
                    he destroyed his own home and killed his wife and daughter. He was tricked by Ares. He later kills Ares and is crowned the new God of War, hence the game's series Name
                    During his rage against the corrupt Greek Gods, he kills all of them and destroys Greece, he regrets his actions and is starting a new life in Norway, this time around things are different.

                <h2>Fun Fact #2</h2>
                <p>The main weapon in God of War 2018 is the Leviathan Axe, unlike the original where Kratos mainly used the Blades of Chaos.
                   This is to indicate a change in the heart of Kratos and how his personality has changed since the original's, it is also a gift from his wife Faye.
                   The weapon is also a direct opposite of Mj√∂lnir which is the weapon Thor uses in the game. Kratos is no longer a blood thirsty god, but Thor is still blood thirsty and enjoys battle.
                   Kratos only seeks to defend himself. Unlike the Blades of Chaos which emanated fire, this one is the opposite and emanates ice or snow.
